## Normalization summary (`opencode`)

- Replaced placeholder-style `quote:` snippets with exact source excerpts for all affected evidence items.
- Added `edit.mechanism_default` (model-conditional default surfaced as `apply_patch`, medium confidence) and preserved conditional behavior detail in evidence and extras.
- Added `extras.*` entries from `reports/opencode.md`: `tools.model_conditional_exposure`, `integration.local_rpc_mode`, `reliability.loop_guard_doom_loop`, and `config.variable_substitution`.
- Kept all existing claims; no fields were removed for missing evidence.
