## Normalization summary (`pi`)

- Applied every blocking fix from `reports/pi-review.md` (line-accurate refs and exact quote substrings), including the broken `name` citation path and quote/ref corrections across `platforms`, `edit.retry_loop`, `tools.available`, `extensions.skills.format`, `ux.sessions`, `context.*`, `reliability.recovery_loops`, `integration.protocol`, `customization.system_prompt`, and `distribution.artifacts`.
- Downgraded `extensions.mcp.confidence` and `ux.review_controls.confidence` from `high` to `medium` per reviewer guidance.
- Kept all existing claims; no fields were removed for missing evidence.
