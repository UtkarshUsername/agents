# Governance (V1)

## Purpose

This project aims to become a neutral, source-backed reference for harness behavior, similar in spirit to “web standards” documentation: transparent, comparable, and verifiable.

## Principles

- Evidence first: claims require citations
- Reproducibility: pin scans to a specific commit when possible
- Neutrality: we document tradeoffs; we don’t do hype
- Extensibility: the data model should evolve cautiously

## Data Model Changes

To add or change fields:

1. Explain why the field improves “pick a harness” decisions.
2. Define the field precisely (type, expected values).
3. Provide examples for at least two harnesses.

## Disputes

If a harness maintainer disputes an entry:

- we prioritize their cited sources
- we correct anything unsourced or misleading quickly
- we keep historical notes if behavior changed over time (with commit references)
